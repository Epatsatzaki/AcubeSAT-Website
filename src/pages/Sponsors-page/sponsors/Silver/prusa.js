  description: "**Prusa Research** was founded as a one -man startup in 2012 by Josef Prusa, a Czech hobbyist, maker and inventor - and now one of the most famous names in the 3D printing industry. Josef found his passion for 3D printers as a student of University of Economics in Prague. That was in 2009. Back then, he considered 3D printing to be nothing but a hobby, an amazing new technology open to changes and improvements. Josef then joined the open-source RepRap project and the rest is history."}
